    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I’m a Civil Engineer from Universidad de Medellín, with specialization in structures at the National University of Colombia. I have two years experience in building design at the company "Diseño & Estructuras S.A.S" and nine (9) months designing road structures at "GICA S.A.S". I can handle programming languages I learned during my career and self-taught, for example, Matlab, C++, Visual Basic for Excel, and Python. Software management: Microsoft Office (Excel, Word...), AutoCAD, Etabs, SAP 2000, Safe, ANSYS. I was a technical supervisor for "JAR ENGINEERING diseños estructurales JAA" of the Mall “La Hacienda” project, in San Antonio de Prado, during which I was trained by Hilti on the subject of anchors, by Cemex in the quality control of concrete and by Sika in the repair of structural concrete.

      <h2>Brazil</h2>
      <p>Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is
        produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state of Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.</p>

        bean. The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region.</p>
